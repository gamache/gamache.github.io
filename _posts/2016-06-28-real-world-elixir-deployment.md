June 2016 was the first of the [EMPEX](https://empex.co/) Elixir
conferences. It was a one-track, one-day conference of technical talks
held in a jazz bar in NYC's SoHo. I had the pleasure of speaking about
"Real World Elixir Deployment", which was my way of describing the
rough-but-working production setup I'd settled upon at the time.
