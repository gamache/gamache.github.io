This is a how-to guide for stovetop distillation. It requires no specialized
apparatus and is good enough for all sorts of small-scale distillation
projects around the house.

You need a metal pot, a round-bottomed (or close to it) metal bowl which is
too large to fit inside the pot, and a Pyrex dish or measuring cup. You also
need a supply of ice cubes. One five-pound bag will distill about 2L of
vodka on my gas stove.

First, HOW NOT TO SET YOURSELF OR YOUR KITCHEN ON FIRE.

* Use a stovetop hood or fan, or aim a room fan at the stove. Make sure
  vapors are carried away.
* Gas stoves: turn off the flame before uncovering a boiling pot.
* Have a pot cover and an extinguisher handy.
* Don’t be stupid

Here goes:

You fill the pot with the liquid to distill.

You then place the empty dish in the center of the pot, taking care to keep
it empty.

The pot goes on the stove, and the bowl is placed atop the pot

…and filled with ice.

As the pot liquor heats up, different chemicals will boil off at their
respective boiling points. These will rise as vapor, condense on the
ice-cold metal bowl, and drip down the side of the bowl and into the Pyrex.

Obviously such a simple still cannot produce precise results, but for
simple tasks not requiring precision, you can’t beat shit you already have.

If you know the expected amount of alcohol (in my case, 1.75L of 40% ABV
vodka = 700mL), then great — you know when to stop. Otherwise, there are
cues. If you listen hard, you can hear the bubbling speed up as the
alcohol starts to boil, then slow down as the alcohol is boiled off
completely, only to speed up again as the water starts to boil. When
the alcohol slows down, that’s a good time to stop.

There are many other compounds with boiling points lower than that of the
alcohol, which come out first. This is especially true when distilling
fermented mash, as opposed to turning crappy vodka into high-proof grain
alcohol. The first stuff to boil often contains a few things you don’t
want. It’s wise to either discard the first bit of distillate that you
collect, or to briefly boil the distillate later. The finished product
can also be passed through a charcoal filter (e.g. Brita) for added cleaning.

This kind of still is not very practical for mash distillation, but it
works fine for purifying vodka and I imagine it would work just as well
for liqueurs. Perhaps I will put an absinthe together in the
not-too-distant future.
