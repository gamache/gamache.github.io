# Google Foobar Code Challenges

One summer afternoon in 2015, I did a Google search for
"go to considered harmful", and was invited to participate
in the Google Foobar code challenge.  It was a fun way to
kill a whole bunch of hours and graph paper over a couple
weeks.

Here are the problems I solved, and one I didn't.
All problem descriptions are Google's, all answers are mine.

* [Rabbit test subjects](rabbit_test_subjects.html)
* [Zombit monitoring](zombit_monitoring.html)
* [Peculiar balance](peculiar_balance.html)
* [Square supplies](square_supplies.html)
* [Hash it out](hash_it_out.html)
* [Minglish lesson](minglish_lesson.html)
* [Carrotland](carrotland.html)
* [Undercover underground](undercover_underground.html)
* [Minion's bored game](minions_bored_game.html)
* [Binary bunnies](binary_bunnies.html)
* [Zombit pandemic](zombit_pandemic.html)
* [Don't mind the map](dont_mind_the_map.html)
* [Grid zero](grid_zero.html)
